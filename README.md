# Share Your Brewfiles

A tool to share your brewfiles with others.

## What is a Brewfile?

Homebrew is one of the most popular package managers for MacOS and Linux. People use it to download command-line tools (like tmux, LazyDocker, and NeoVim), libraries (like C, C++, and Rust), dev environments (like MySQL, Apache, and Nginx), and applications (like Warp, Raycast, or Zoom)!

Brewfiles is just a simple txt file that includes all packages and applications that are installed on the system via Homebrew!

## Uploading a Brewfile

To upload your brewfile, run the following command in your terminal:
